I recently had a disk failure or corrupted partition with a btrfs partition.
On boot it kept getting a stack trace running btrfs balance.

Before running any recovery commands, I wanted to get some files off the 
disk so I booted off a USB disk into rescue mode.

It took me a while to figure out how to mount the btrfs subvolumes.

I couldn't find "how to mount subvolumes" mentioned in any TIDs.
Did I overlook a TID with this info?

If not, shouldn't we add this to one of the "rescue" TIDs?
Maybe this one:

Ultimately I found these steps and they worked:
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
btrfs subvolume list -p /mnt
mount -o subvolid=264 /dev/sda2 /mnt/var/lib/named

Is this the correct way to mount the btrfs subvolumes?
Is this a correct "rescue" method?

I was able to recover my files then I was able to recover the primary 
partition following some of the btrfs recovery TIDs.
