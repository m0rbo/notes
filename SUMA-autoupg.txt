Couple months back I was trying to get? an autoinstallation lab with Igor from L1, I noticed parts of this documentation aren't exactly complete too.


Samuel Snow sent him a small guide of working options

Here are the?autoinstallation upgrade instructions for this customer.
1 - Configure a Distribution for SLES for SAP?upgrade to SLES 15 SP3
A) Documentationhttps://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.2/en/suse-manager/client-configuration/client-upgrades-major.html
The customer already followed this, looking at their email, it looks like they have most of this configured properly.


We'll go over the things they may be missing below.
B) Channel Mirroring
They mentioned they should have everything mirrored already, which is good.


2 - Configuring?the Profile

A) Profile Kernel Options
When configuring the profile, there is a "Kernel Options" area.?


Using the information they passed over, I recommend they try these options:autoupgrade=1 insecure=1 useonlinerepo install=http://172.21.50.62/ks/dist/sles-15-sp3-sap self_update=0
B) File Contents /?Autoinstallation Script
Have them use the attached script "SLES_SAP_12SP5-to-SLES_SAP_15SP3.xml"

C) Profile Variables
Select the "Variables Tab".


At least these variables should be configured:registration_key=1-Autoinstallation-update-sles-15-sp3-sap org=1 distrotree=sles-15-sp3-sap

They'll want to double-check these values.
The "registration_key" should be the activation key they want used after the upgrade.


It should be preceded by a "1-" (found in SUSE Manager>Systems>Activation keys).The distrotree value is the distribution label.
Many of the other variables in the script will get populated automatically.


They can verify if the variables are configured correctly, by navigating to the "Autoinstallation File" tab and run a "ctrl-f" in the browser; search for?$.


They should only see 4 results, in the "YAOU_SYSCFGFILE=" section.


Otherwise, there is probably a missing variable.


3 - Running the Upgrade

A)?Static Network Configuration
If DHCP is unavailable, a static network configuration should be used, and added to the individual system's kernel options during the upgrade (Under "Advanced Configuration" mentioned in the next step).


See the documentation here under "Static Network Configuration":https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP3/single-html/SLES-autoyast/#ay-adv-network

B) Initiating the Upgrade
Navigate to the system in the SUSE Manager webUI > Provisioning > Schedule.


Select the profile, then "Advanced Configuration".


For Kernel Options select "As specified by the profile".


If everything looks good select "Schedule?Autoinstallation and Finish"

C) Watching the Upgrade
If you have console access, you can watch the upgrade.


After this point the upgrade should be completely automated.


If all goes to plan, the system will receive grub configuration changes, reboot by itself, load and begin the?autoinstallation.


After it's done with the installation, it will reboot itself, and it should re-register itself to SUSE Manager.

D) Errors:
I tested the above?autoinstallation, and it worked in my environment.


If the customer has errors, have them take screenshots and update the support case.

4) Additional Topics
The customer may have additional questions about orphan packages, and perhaps arriving at CLM channels instead of base channels during the upgrade. If they have a successful test, we can talk about these other topics.
